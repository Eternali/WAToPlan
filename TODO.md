In order of priority / projected time until implementation is finished: 
1. add more home layout views
    - e.g. by week, day or month
2. add SMS and email reminders (will require an alarm manager of sorts (hopefully easier to integrate than current solutions)
3. add location and relevant people support
4. allow ability to change the time parameter that notifications are based off
5. more intuitive navigation and data entry.
6. allow for remote data backup with firebase
7. improve local storage method (needs big efficiency improvement)
